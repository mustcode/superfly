# Superfly Extruder
### A Compact BMG Conversion

The Superfly is a compact extruder designed to reuse the excellent dual drive gears of the beloved BMG extruder.
If you already own a BMG or its internals, the only other parts you need are:
- an M3 nut
- and some M3 screws for mounting (6mm-12mm depending on your motor and mounting needs).
If you're going to be running a reverse-bowden, you'll also need:
- an embeded bowden collet
- and some ptfe tubing.

For the motor, both NEMA 17 and the round NEMA 14 motors are supported. A scalable spacer is also provided to compensate for the differences in shaft length, so there's a good chance your'll have a compatible motor on hand.

Printing recommendation:
- The main housing should be printed "face down" as oriented in the STL, the model is designed to minimize supports in this orientation.
- Supports are only needed where the two motor mount holes are. Other overhangs and bridges should be easily printable on most printers.
- Raft should be enabled unless you're very confident in your bed-adhesion.
- The tensioner should be printed with plenty of walls and infill to make sure that it doesn't break under stress.
- As with most mechanical prints, your printer should be capable of producing parts with decent dimensional accuracy. If you found that your printed parts are too tight, try the "extra_clearance" version of the main housing instead.

Post Print:
- Clean up holes with drills
- Check that all parts fit together and sand if necessary.
