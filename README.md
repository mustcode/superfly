# Superfly Extruder
### A BMG Compact Conversion Mod

This is a compact extruder designed to reuse the excellent dual drive gears of the tried and true BMG extruder.
If you already own a BMG or its internals, the only other parts you need are:
- an M3 nut
- some M3 screws
- an embeded bowden collet
- and some ptfe tubing.

For the motor, both NEMA 17 and the round NEMA 14 motors are supported. A scalable spacer is also provided to compensate for the differences in shaft length, so there's a good chance your'll have a compatible motor on hand.

Printing recommendation:
- The main housing should be printed "face down" as oriented in the STL, with raft enabled and supports at the motor mount holes.
- The tensioner should be printed with plenty of walls and high infill to make sure that it doesn't break under stress.
- As with all prints with interlocking mechanical parts, your printer should be capable of producing parts with decent dimensional accuracy.
